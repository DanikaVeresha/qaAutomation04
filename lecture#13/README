PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Our company is located in a business center ranging from floors 5 to 22 inclusive.
On the ground floor of the center in the hall there is a turnstile with a monitor and a pass scanner.

Operation in the lobby ->
When a person approaches the turnstile, he scans his pass card and the system performs an identity
check (ID):
- if a person is in the company’s database as an employee or a registered visitor, the turnstile opens
and the person can follow the elevator to go up to the desired floor of his company.
- if a person is not in the company database as an employee or a registered visitor, the turnstile is
closed and the person cannot proceed to the floor he needs, about which the system gives him a notification.

Next ->

Elevator operation ->
- A person presses the floor he needs, which belongs to the company in the database in which he is
registered - the elevator goes to the floor he needs.
- If a person presses a button for a floor that does not belong to the company in the database in which
the person is registered, the elevator does not follow and asks the person to enter the correct floor
number for the company in which he works.
Identity verification in accordance with registration in the company database is carried out by Last Name,
First Name and UUID of the person if the person is an employee, if a visitor then only by Last Name,
First Name in the Visitor database
