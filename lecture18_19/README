In the app file, I created a primitive application that creates an object of the User
class with data, the essence of the application is that the user can create an order
(a link to the site, or manually enter the value of what he wants to buy) and also
register and log in to the site, the program remembers the order and forms it with
probable date of receipt (the date of receipt is calculated randomly from 1-4 days
from the day the user created the order). Tests for the validity of user data during
its creation and class methods are developed in the tests directory. I decided to play
a little with the pytest.
